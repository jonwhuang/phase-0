####What is an integer? What is a float?
- An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with.

####What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
- An integer division will only yield an integer, while a float division can yield a float. If you typed in 9/2, you would get 4 because it returns an integer (rounding down). If you typed in 9.0/2.0 you would get 4.5 (a float value).

###Release 2

- hours in a year
```
puts 24 * 365
```

- minutes in a decade
```
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
```

###Release 7
####How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
- Ruby handles arithmetic using the methods +, -, *, and / to perform the calculations.

####What is the difference between integers and floats?
- Integers don't have a decimal point, but floats do.

####What is the difference between integer and float division?
- Integer division returns an integer. If there was a decimal point after the division, the number is rounded down. Float divison returns a float.

####What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
- Strings are basically groups of letters. They can also include digits, punctuation, and spaces in them. Strings can be added together to connect them together.

####What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
- Local variables are a way to save numbers or strings that are assigned to it. They can be used as a placeholder for whatever is assigned to them.

####How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
