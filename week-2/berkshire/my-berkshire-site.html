Actually using HTML to build an actual site definitely helped me solidify my previous learning of HTML from codecademy. I found that just following the instructions on codecademy didn't really help me remember how to do everything. Practicing with it on an actual website helped me actually learn and remember the setup and what the tags do.

My pair and I researched a little bit about HTML5 but we were a little confused about what the difference between sections and divs really made. Sections seemed to be a little more specific as to what is grouped together and where, but for our website, it felt like divs worked fine for it.  We divided the content up into divs based on the different parts of the website. We definitely want to shift into using HTML5 though, with its header, footer, and sections. It will be more specific.

HTML seems very easy to setup and use, though it has a limit on what you can actually do with it. Essentially, you can get a website up and running with just HTML but it may not be as attractive and there's no formatting by itself. We only focused on setting up the website with links and images without worrying about the actual formatting. This made sure that we didn't add in formatting somehow and to make sure it was similar to the sample.

I don't really know of any special tricks to writing HTML. I think the best way to start is to set up the required tags like the doctype, html, head, title, and body tags. The head tag, which describes the HTML file, includes the title tag and other tags like charset. The charset specifies which character set will be used in the HTML page. After setting up, you can divide the body into sections to outline what will be in the website before actually building the code. I confused markdown with HTML a little bit, and my pair helped point it out and cleared it up for me!
