* What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  - Information Gathering: Determining the goals and purpose of the site, as well as the content and the audience the content is intended for
  - Planning: Creating the site map based on information gathered
  - Design: Deciding what the site will look like based on audience and the other information gathered
  - Development: Website is created using HTML and CSS to work towards the goals of the design phase
  - Testing and Delivery: Making sure that all of the code and the website works and any feedback obtained can be factored into changes made. Website is hosted and uploaded to the web.
  - Maintenance: Updating and maintaining the website over time for new content or changes
  Each phase of web design is linked to the previous phase before it to work towards a completed website.
* What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  - My site's primary goal will be to share my background and work to others. It will be maintained and updated to feature the projects completed as well as information about myself and how to contact me if needed.
* What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  - The target audience's interest will be mainly for assessing my capabilities coding. The site will be geared towards showing my work to the audience. Of course, the site will be continuously updated so the audience may change later on for a more specific goal.
* What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  - I think the primary "action" I would want a user to take would be to either look at the about me first, or look at my portfolio. The about me should get the visitors interested in looking at my portfolio, and the portfolio should have a goal to try to convince them to contact me.
* What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  - Design and user experience are definitely linked in many ways. The design is not successful unless it is successful with the user experience. Even if the designer was satisfied with the result of the website, it isn't successful unless users enjoyed their experience and continued to use it.
  - Design should be focused towards solving the problems that the users are interested in. If some function of the site wasn't working very well and users gave feedback about it, the design should focus on fixing that problem so that user experience improves.
* What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  - User experience design is user-centered design that takes the feelings a user feels when interacting with a site as the main influencer. Design decisions are to be based on the needs and wants of the users who are using the site.
  - Because everyone's opinions are different, designers must take into account the feedback from using their designs. Then, they have to optimize their design to try to satisfy their target audience to the best of their abilities.
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  - I didn't really find any parts of the challenge tedious. I want to figure out if there's a way to see if my markdown inline image works before I push to GitHub.
