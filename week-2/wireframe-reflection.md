* What is a wireframe?
  - A wireframe is like a blueprint for a webpage. It lets the web designer plan the layout of the site before moving on to actually build the site. Wireframes typically include a header, body, and footer. The header will be the first attention-grabber that users will see, followed by the body content, and then the less important stuff in the footer.
* What are the benefits of wireframing?
  - Wireframing allows the designer to plan out the site before actually adding in the details. This will show where the buttons, images, and other functions of the site will be located. Changes can be made very easily during the wireframing process, rather than during the coding process. It is also easier to test out user interaction with the current setups during wireframing. (i.e. what they see first, or which buttons they are more likely to click)
* Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  - I found wireframing pretty enjoyable. I didn't spend a whole lot of time on it since we didn't have too much to put on the website right now, but I had fun playing around with the different types of buttons and setup using the Mockingbird wireframing site.
* Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  - I had a general idea of what I wanted the wireframe to look like, but I did also end up changing it and moving things around to try and see what would look better.
* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  - I definitely asked myself, what would a normal home page contain? What would a blog page contain? I tried to figure out what else I could put onto my page, since it felt a little empty in the beginning. I browsed the blogs and home pages of some random sites to get a feel for what else people also include in their sites. For example, the search button on a blog home page was a good idea so I put it in as well.
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  - This challenge was mainly just wireframing our index and blog index page, and I definitely enjoyed playing around with it. It's very convenient how easy it is to change something when wireframing. I did try to find a free website that I could use all the time for wireframing, but all of the "free" wireframing sites had some type of limit to it. I looked at Mockingbird first, but realized it was only one week free and tried to look at some other ones but ended up going back to Mockingbird.
