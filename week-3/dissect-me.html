      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
      Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
      learn how to dissect an HTML page from the head to the footer, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the <a href="#">HTML docs</a>) and begin!

    <section>
      <h1>Release 0: Set up</h1>
      <p>
        Decide who will drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
        <li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
        <li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
        <li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes.</li>
        <li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: <a href="#">https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html</a></li>
      </ul>
      <footer>
      NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

The main HTML5 tags used in the challenge were section and footer.
I will definitely return to using section, since it is used very often in html pages.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements are laid out on the page based on the order they are in in the html file.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned about snippets! It will definitely save a lot of typing and I will try to make more of my own.
I also learned a couple more shortcuts that I didn't know how to use before.
I also want to figure out how sublime can autocomplete closing tags.
