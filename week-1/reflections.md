#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

For the research portion of this assignment, I looked a little bit at meditation, learning ruby the hard way, the pomodoro technique, as well as creating a habit. From those different resources, I focused and researched more on the pomodoro technique. What is interesting is that only yesterday, my friend was telling me about how he was able to study very efficiently using the pomodoro technique. I had no idea what it was at the time, and he only described it to me as “25 minutes of studying and a 5 minute break.” As a result, when the pomodoro technique was on the list of the different productivity and time management ideas, I gravitated towards learning more about it.

The pomodoro technique is a type of timebox method. Basically, a timebox method is used when the user sets a specific amount of time that they would dedicate their entire focus to the work at hand, and when the time is up, they would reflect back on how much progress they made and evaluate the productivity. The timebox method can definitely be employed using the pomodoro technique, since the pomodoro technique is focused on a set amount of time (25 minutes) and a 5 minute break in between each session.

Currently, I don’t think I manage my time very well. Usually when I need to work on something, I will set aside a block of time where I can work until I meet my goals. I know that a lot of times, I end up needing to take a break because I get tired over time and cannot concentrate as well. After the break, I know everything becomes clearer and sometimes I am able to get past a roadblock when I am stuck on something. I have not used the pomodoro technique before, which requires you to set a timer for 25 minutes, and when the 25 minutes are up, you take a break, whether or not you are done with your goal or not. This allows for the mechanical and routine process of taking breaks and letting your mind rest and reset. You are supposed to estimate how many pomodoros (25 minute intervals) it will take to finish the work at hand. After three pomodoro sessions, you take a longer break (15-20 minutes). Supposedly, it also makes you concentrate better in order to try to meet the goals that are set. I want to start using the technique for my work, especially after coincidentally hearing about the success of it from my friend yesterday.

I know that it might be hard trying to work with the time constraint of the pomodoro timer. When I think about it, 25 minutes does not seem like a lot. This is where the creating a habit video helped a lot with the way it can be psychologically set up. Working for the 25 minutes and taking a 5 minute break will be a goal that I will also set up for myself, in order to create the habit of using the pomodoro technique.

I don’t like leaving assignments to the last minute, because of the stress and pressure I end up getting if I try to finish it all right before a deadline. Currently, I work 4 days a week and I’m planning on changing to 3 days of work a week. This way, I have 3 days to work during the week, and Sunday as a backup day in case some assignments take longer than originally planned.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a program in our computer that allows us to type in commands and have the operating system execute them. When using the command line, we will be utilizing a shell to process and execute the commands, a process called shell scripting. “Bash” is a type of shell that we will use in DBC to execute the commands we send to the computer.The .bash_profile is customizable by the user.

I was able to successfully use all the commands. I went through them all the first day, and try to test and make sure that I could still utilize them and remember their separate uses the next couple days. I think that the most important commands will probably be pwd/ls to remember which directory you are currently at, the pipes and redirection, and grep.

I feel that pwd/ls will be utilized very often because the user will constantly need to know where they are working in the directory, and because in the video we watched, Steven Harms does seem to use the ls command a lot as well.

I struggled the most with pipes and redirection. I can tell that they will be very useful because of how it helps shorten the amount of lines you have to type to obtain a specific result by condensing everything into one command. However, it took a bit of practice for me to remember how each symbol worked.

Grep also seems to be very useful. It is used to search inside files that exist in the directory. You can search for a word, or a phrase. In order to ignore capitalization, you can add -i after grep as well otherwise “hi” is not equal to “Hi"

* pwd - prints working directory. Helps the user locate which directory they are currently in.
* ls - List directory. Lists out all the files, directories, and content that are located in the current directory the user is in.
* mv - Move directory or file. Moves (renames) a file or directory to another location. Can also use cp to copy a file and have two copies instead of just one.
* cd - Change directory. Used to move between different directories. ../ is used to move back one directory. Can be chained (like ../../) to move back 2 or more directories.
* touch - Create a new empty file in the current directory.
* mkdir - Creates a new directory in the current directory.
* less - Opens up the contents of a file but only shows one page at a time. Can be scrolled through. If you want to view an entire file at once on the screen, you use cat instead of less.
* rmdir - Deletes and removes an existing directory. The directory must be empty.
* rm - Removes the specified file. Can also be used recursively to remove an entire directory
* help - Typing man (command_name) into command line brings up the help manual for that specific command, including all of the extra options that can be used to customize the command to the user’s needs

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repository using GitHub, you would go to your main profile page. In the top right hand corner, you click on the + sign and create a new repository. You enter in the name of the new repository, decide if you want the repository to be public or private, and add a license if needed. For our purposes, we chose the MIT License. Once the repository is created, you need to clone the repository to your computer so that you can add your own work to it. On the right hand side of the repository page, there is an clone URL link that you copy. In the command line terminal, you check and navigate to the directory where you want to place the repository. Then, you type “git clone (copied URL)” and hit enter. A GitHub repository should be forked because a copy of the repository will be taken and made in our own GitHub profile. This allows us to work on the repository without changing the original version that the repository was taken from. By doing so, the changes that are made will only be reflected on your own copy and can be used for personal use, or reviewed before final submission to the original copy. Forking a repository is very easy on GitHub as well. On the repository page you want to fork, you click on fork on the right hand side and the account you want to fork it to.

I didn’t have too much trouble setting up git and GitHub by following the instructions. However, I have not yet figured out how to open up the file in Sublime after I have cloned it with the command line. I do not recall learning a command for us to open the file in Sublime yet, but I will have to review a bit and see if I missed something somewhere.

I was definitely a little confused what GitHub was ultimately used for. I knew it was used for version control and for a lot of people to be able to work on the same project all at one time but I didn’t understand how Github helped. Now that I see how the repositories work, it made more sense.
